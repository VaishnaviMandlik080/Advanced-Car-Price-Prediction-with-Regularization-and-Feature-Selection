# 🚗 Advanced Car Price Prediction

Predicting used car prices using machine learning with feature selection and regularization techniques to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## 🔍 Project Description

This project uses Python-based data analysis and regression models (like Lasso and Ridge) to predict car prices based on features such as brand, mileage, manufacturing year, fuel type, and engine capacity. Feature selection techniques are applied to enhance performance and interpretability.
